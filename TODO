Todo:
  ☐ first version without renaming files, LETS GO
  ☐ move entry file to /index.js, this could be done via regex to select all requires then rewrite require using https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v12.x/docs/api/path.html#path_path_relative_from_to
  ☐ use jsii to build for other languages
  ☐ allow native modules, by installing into a different folder with npm_config_arch and npm_config_platform and aliasing in rollup configuration
  ☐ allow rollup options, like externals if user is using aws layers
  ☐ double check handler index output file
